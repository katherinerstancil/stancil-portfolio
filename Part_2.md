# User research

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

Since my target audience is for parents, legislators, and school board members, I will try to keep my target audience towards individuals who are either parents or soon-to-be parents. Therefore, I chose the following individuals:
1. Anna (mid-40s)
2. Adrian (late 20s)
3. Tamara (early 30s)
