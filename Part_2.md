# User research

## Target audience

Since my target audience for my project is parents, legislators, and school board members, I will try to keep my interview pool similar to my target audience by getting feedback from individuals who are either parents or individuals with a policy background. The following people were interviewed:

1. Brooke (early 20s - undergraduate political science major)
2. Tamara (early 30s - a mother, family friend)
3. Anna (mid-40s, a mother, my aunt)
4. Adrian (early 50s, a father, my uncle)

## Interview script 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Understand overall effectiveness of the site. Flow, main ideas, general feedback.    |  1. What is the main takeaway? 2. What happened to PSSA scores after virtual learning? 3. What do you think about the overall flow of the site? 4. Who do you think is the target audience? 5. Did you notice a color scheme? If so, did you like it or would you have chosen something else? 6. Was there anything confusing? 7. What section would you want to learn more about? 8. What was lacking from the site? Where can I improve? 9. What are some areas you think I need to spend more time developing the site? 10. Additional Recommendations?                |
|   Visualization 1 Critique   |   1. What do you like about this visualization? 2. Did you find anything confusing about this visual? 3. What is the focal point of the visual? 4. Is there anything you didn't like about this visual?               |
|   Visualization 2 Critique   | 1. Do you think this visualization supplements the text or is it a distraction?                 |
|  Visualization 3 Critique    |   1. What did you like about this visual? 2. Did you find anything confusing about this visual? 3. What are your thoughts on the color scheme? Do you think it makes sense to keep the darker colors the lowest values? 4. Do you like the full map option or the one where it is on the side of the text (views may be different based on whether you used a phone or laptop)?               |
|  Visualization 4 Critique    |   1. Is the bar chart clear? 2. Are the labels distracting? (the gray bar will be removed, still collecting actual data to build real visual) 3. Do you think the red and yellow works well with the color scheme of the rest of the document? If not, what would you recommend I change it to?               |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview Brooke | Interview Tamara | Interview Anna | Interview Adrian |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is the main takeaway? | "Covid 19 was detrimental to children’s education"           | "My main takeaway is how PSSA is affected after COVID-19 due to virtual learning and virtual classes"            | "The COVID-19 lockdown and online school negatively effective students in Pennsylvania (and across the US) and many are unaware of the severity of the learning loss"            | "The website looks like organized as it flows through its argument on the significance virtual learning had on kids testing rates."            |
| What happened to PSSA scores after virtual learning?                        |  "They dropped by over 5%"                              | "The PSSA scores on math were not proficient in almost half of the schools in PA, and 30% of schools did not have the majority of their students meeting proficiency on the ELA PSSAs"            | "Average scores dropped by over 5%"            | "They dropped significantly from 60%-48% now."            |
| What do you think about the overall flow of the site?                        | "The flow was rather nice and the information flowed nicely in this format"                               |"I think it has good flow. It introduces the issue, it gives the facts and statistics and it comes with suggestions for a solutions at the end"             |"I like it, the colors flow very well and the information is easily digestible"             |"As stated earlier, the website flows nicely guiding us through the argument." |
| Who do you think is the target audience?                        |   "Parents and/or school boards and districts"                             | "Parents, school board members, professors, and legislators"            |"I think the main audience is educators and parents"             |  "It looks more like it’s intended for an academic focused audience, maybe parents as well."           |
| Did you notice a color scheme? If so, did you like it or would you have chosen something else?                        | "I enjoyed the dark background with the bright writing"                               |"Yes, the focus is on orange, grey and brown. I like it. It’s not too bright nor too dark"             | "Yes, I like it because it added a nice touch to the flow and look of the site without being distracting from the information"            | "The color scheme is neutral, which is good it doesn’t distract from the argument."            |
| What is the most surprising piece of information from the site?                        |  "That 30% of schools students didn’t reach proficiency on state tests for ELA and half didn’t for math"                              | "I was the most surprised about the amount of students not meeting ELA and math scores and how much virtual learning impacted PSSA scores"            | "The most surprising was the last graph showing the proficiency continuing to decline, even years after the shut down"            | "The 3 year trend chart on school proficiency"            |
|  Was there anything confusing?                       | "No, I think it flowed well and was explained well"                               | "In my opinion, no"            |"The two statistics about the school meeting their proficiency with ELA and math was a bit confusing at first because i didnt see the different subjects, but I initially read over it very quickly"             | "The 2022 proficiency section seems like it’s a work in progress."             |
| What section would you want to learn more about?                        |  "Where we are now and how we are actively trying to improve this issue"                              |"I would like to know more about what the other things that influenced the PSSA scores due to virtual learning"             | "I would love to know more about where we are now and if there are any initiatives to change the downward trend"            | "The solutions section, maybe go in depth about the actions to take."            |
| What was lacking from the site? Where can I improve?                        |  "The beginning is really wordy and it made me not want to read it. After that the colors drew me in and same with the charts and pictures"                              |  "I think it has good flow and presents a problem clearly"           | "I am curious if remote learning disproportionally affected minority groups"            | "The solutions as well as the 2022 proficiency section."            |
| What are some areas you think I need to spend more time developing the site?                        |  "I’m not really sure"                              | "In my opinion none"            | "I would work more on the 3 year trend graph and change the colors to fit better in with the color scheme of the site"            | "The interface of the website such as the spacing could use some adjustment. I’m using my phone so not sure how it looks on computer."            |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. What do you like about this visualization?                        | "I liked the bright orange color and the graphs as a visual"                                | "I like because it shows the importance of the 5% and that it may sound like a small amount but it’s actually not"            | "It is very simple making it very easy to read and digest"            | "It’s straightforward and to the point."            |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. Did you find anything confusing about this visual?                        | "No, I really liked it and it helped me understand better"                               | "No"             | "No, thought it was very easy to read"            | "Nothing looked confusing. Not sure if the 5.2% loss needs to be highlighted but it doesn’t throw off the graphic."            |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. What is the focal point of the visual?                        | "the graphs showing the proficiency and loss"                               |"Even tho 5% seems like a low number, this visual is showing the importance of the 5%"             | "The focal point is the 5% loss in average PSSA school proficiency"            |"To visualize the loss in PSA school proficiency"             |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. Is there anything you didn't like about this visual?                        |  "No"                              | "No"            | "I think it would've been nice to see"            |   "No it looks good."          |
| Visual 2: 2/4 Schools. Do you think this visualization supplements the text or is it a distraction?                        | "The white backgrounds are a little distracting just because it’s bright on a dark background" (I think this was meant for the map)                               |"It supplements the text"             | "yes, this was my favorite visual"            | "I’m a bit confused on the 2/4 Schools visual location."            |
| Visual 3: PA Map. What did you like about this visual?                         | "I liked how it was interactive"                               | "I loved how it clearly emphasizes and shows that the proficiency rates across PA is more towards 36% (on a lower end)"            |  "The key made it very easy to understand and allowed me to see an interesting point of view of how geographically different areas were effected"           | "I like how it’s interactive clicking on each district."            |
| Visual 3: PA Map. Did you find anything confusing about this visual?                        |  "No"                              |  "No"           | "No"            | "No, but it would be nice to have each shade labelled"             |
| Visual 3: PA Map. What are your thoughts on the color scheme? Do you think it makes sense to keep the darker colors the lowest values?                        | "Yes I think it does and I enjoyed the color scheme. The bright color on dark makes you want to read it and pulls you in"                               | "I liked it, I think it clearly emphasizes the majority of the lowest values"            | "Yes, I agree with it and most visuals I have seen have the darker colors correlate to lower values"            | "It makes sense, I like the color scheme"            |
|  Visual 3: PA Map. Do you like the full map option or the one where it is on the side of the text (views may be different based on whether you used a phone or laptop)?                       | "side of the text"                                | "I like a full map option because that way you can clearly see the colors"            |  "I like it where it is on the side"           | "I believe mine might be side of text since I’m using my phone, but if it could be bigger than that would be ideal."            |
| Visual 4: Bar Chart. Is the bar chart clear?                        | "Yes"                               |  "Yes"           |  "Yes"           | "The bar chart is very clear"            |
|  Visual 4: Bar Chart. Are the labels distracting? (the gray bar will be removed, still collecting actual data to build real visual)                       |  "No"                              | "No"            | "No, I thought it was well labeled"            | "No they’re not distracting"            |
| Visual 4: Bar Chart. Do you think the red and yellow works well with the color scheme of the rest of the document? If not, what would you recommend I change it to?                        | "I didn’t really like the yellow and red. I feel like the yellow is fine but maybe like blue and beige color or brown and blue"                               |"I think that the red and yellow go good together and with the rest of the document, but the numbers on the yellow graph are slightly harder to see"             | "I would recommend changing it. Instead of the black background, I would go with a shade of gray and the bars navy blue and dark green"            |  "It works"           |
| Any additional recommendations?                        |  "nope"                              |"No, good job!"             |   "Distinguish the two quotes about math and ELA PSSAs a little more"          | "It looks good! Just go in depth about some solutions."            |


# Identified changes for Part III 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statistics section. | The statistics section received feedback about being too close together and hard to pull out relevant information. Moving forward, I think I’m going to try to separate them more with space, make the sentences less wordy, and play around with other design techniques like color and pictures to separate them better.  |
| Build out 2022 section.                                         |   I got a lot of feedback to change the colors of the last data visualization. I might change the visual all together. I wanted to get feedback before I created anything new because I wasn’t in love with my initial idea in the first place. However, the feedback was based more on color, not on the chart type. I will brainstorm how else to display the data.                                                                              |
| Any current initiatives in PA? More solutions?                                         | Some interviewees were interested to see if Pennsylvania had any current initiatives to address the virtual learning impacts. I am unaware of any at the moment, but I will research some as it seemed like it was a trend.                                                                                |
| Location of map.                                         | I asked my interviewees their opinion about where I should put the map. The majority said that I should keep it located next to the text rather than a separate page.                                                                                |
| Label shades.            |  An easy fix is putting the shade ranges in the legend. It was only mentioned once in the interview process, but I think it can help with readability.                                                                               |
 

Overall, I have some additional work to do like finalizing what visual I want to use for the 2022 data. I received positive feedback with a few revisions that will help with readability and clarity.
