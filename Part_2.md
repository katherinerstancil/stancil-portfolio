# User research

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

Since my target audience is for parents, legislators, and school board members, I will try to keep my target audience towards individuals who are either parents or individuals with a policy background. Therefore, I chose the following individuals:

1. Brooke (early 20s - undergraduate political science major)
3. Tamara (early 30s - a mother, family friend)
4. Anna (mid-40s, a mother, my aunt)

## Interview script 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Understand overall effectiveness of the site.    |  1. What is the main takeaway? 2. What happened to PSSA scores after virtual learning? 3. What do you think about the overall flow of the site? 4. Who do you think is the target audience? 5. Did you notice a color scheme? If so, did you like it or would you have chosen something else? 6. Was there anything confusing? 7. What section would you want to learn more about? 8. What was lacking from the site? Where can I improve? 9. What are some areas you think I need to spend more time developing the site? 10. Additional Recommendations?                |
|   Visualization 1 Critique   |   1. What do you like about this visualization? 2. Did you find anything confusing about this visual? 3. What is the focal point of the visual? 4. Is there anything you didn't like about this visual?               |
|   Visualization 2 Critique   | 1. Do you think this visualization supplements the text or is it a distraction?                 |
|  Visualization 3 Critique    |   1. What did you like about this visual? 2. Did you find anything confusing about this visual? 3. What are your thoughts on the color scheme? Do you think it makes sense to keep the darker colors the lowest values? 4. Do you like the full map option or the one where it is on the side of the text (views may be different based on whether you used a phone or laptop)?               |
|  Visualization 4 Critique    |   1. Is the bar chart clear? 2. Are the labels distracting? (the gray bar will be removed, still collecting actual data to build real visual) 3. Do you think the red and yellow works well with the color scheme of the rest of the document? If not, what would you recommend I change it to?               |

| What happened to PSSA scores after virtual learning?                        |  "They dropped by over 5%"                              | "The PSSA scores on math were not proficient in almost half of the schools in PA, and 30% of schools did not have the majority of their students meeting proficiency on the ELA PSSAs"            |             |             |
| What do you think about the overall flow of the site?                        | "The flow was rather nice and the information flowed nicely in this format"                               |"I think it has good flow.

| Who do you think is the target audience?                        |   "Parents and/or school boards and districts"                             | "Parents, school board members, professors, and legislators"            |             |             |

I like it. It’s not too bright nor too dark"             |             |             |
| What is the most surprising piece of information from the site?                        |  "That 30% of schools students didn’t reach proficiency on state tests for ELA and half didn’t for math"                              | "I was the most surprised about the amount of students not meeting ELA and math scores and how much virtual learning impacted PSSA scores"            |             |             |
|  Was there anything confusing?                       | "No, I think it flowed well and was explained well"                               | "In my opinion, no"            |             |             |
| What section would you want to learn more about?                        |  "Where we are now and how we are actively trying to improve this issue"                              |"I would like to know more about what the other things that influenced the PSSA scores due to virtual learning"             |             |             |
| What was lacking from the site? Where can I improve?                        |  "The beginning is really wordy and it made me not want to read it. After that the colors drew me in and same with the charts and pictures"                              |  "I think it has good flow and presents a problem clearly"           |             |             |
| What are some areas you think I need to spend more time developing the site?                        |  "I’m not really sure"                              | "In my opinion none"            |             |             |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. What do you like about this visualization?                        | "I liked the bright orange color and the graphs as a visual"                                | "I like because it shows the importance of the 5% and that it may sound like a small amount but it’s actually not"            |             |             |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. Did you find anything confusing about this visual?                        | "No, I really liked it and it helped me understand better"                               | "No"             |             |             |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. What is the focal point of the visual?                        | "the graphs showing the proficiency and loss"                               |"Even tho 5% seems like a low number, this visual is showing the importance of the 5%"             |             |             |
| Visualization 1: Average PSSA School Proficiency. Is there anything you didn't like about this visual?                        |  "No"                              | "No"            |             |             |
| Visual 2: 2/4 Schools. Do you think this visualization supplements the text or is it a distraction?                        | "The white backgrounds are a little distracting just because it’s bright on a dark background" (I think this was meant for the map)                               |"It supplements the text"             |             |             |

| Visual 3: PA Map. Did you find anything confusing about this visual?                        |  "No"                              |  "No"           |             |             |
| Visual 3: PA Map. What are your thoughts on the color scheme? Do you think it makes sense to keep the darker colors the lowest values?                        | "Yes I think it does and I enjoyed the color scheme. The bright color on dark makes you want to read it and pulls you in"                               | "I liked it, I think it clearly emphasizes the majority of the lowest values"            |             |             |
|  Visual 3: PA Map. Do you like the full map option or the one where it is on the side of the text (views may be different based on whether you used a phone or laptop)?                       | "side of the text"                                | "I like a full map option because that way you can clearly see the colors"            |             |             |
| Visual 4: Bar Chart. Is the bar chart clear?                        | "Yes"                               |  "Yes"           |             |             |
|  Visual 4: Bar Chart. Are the labels distracting? (the gray bar will be removed, still collecting actual data to build real visual)                       |  "No"                              | "No"            |             |             |
| Visual 4: Bar Chart. Do you think the red and yellow works well with the color scheme of the rest of the document? If not, what would you recommend I change it to?                        | "I didn’t really like the yellow and red. I feel like the yellow is fine but maybe like blue and beige color or brown and blue"                               |"I think that the red and yellow go good together and with the rest of the document, but the numbers on the yellow graph are slightly harder to see"             |             |             |
| Any additional recommendations?                        |  "nope"                              |"No, good job!"             |             |             |
