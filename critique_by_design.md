# Critique By Design
### Original Data Visualization

### Data Visualization Critique
#### *Usefulness: 3*
I gave this visualization a 3 for usefulness because it does not communicate the information effectively for the user to actually use it. It requires a lot of memorization of data points to get the full scope of the data.

#### *Completeness: 4*
This visual received a 4 because at first glance, the audience cannot easily understand what the farm share is. The other text boxes crowd the farm share description, which is essential for someone who is unfamiliar with the topic.

#### *Perceptibility: 1*
I rated this visualization a 1 for perceptiblity because the it takes a lot of effort for the user to digest the information. The use of circles makes it really hard for the viewer to distinguish the sizes of some of the cirlces. For example, cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, peaches, and apples all look like the same value, but they are actually 4 distict percentages. The viewer can see that they are similar, but it really does not allow to do much further than that.

#### *Truthfulness: 8*
I gave this visualization an 8 for truthfulness because it displays the data in a way that would not deceive the audience. I also like how the visual gave a disclaimer that the dates may vary because of the availability of data, but it was because that was the most recent data. However, I deducted the visual because there was definitely more recent data available by several years, and the interactive data could be easily updated.

#### *Intuitiveness: 5*
This visual seems to have a pretty neutral intuitiveness, so I gave it a 5. I would say that the visual itself is easy to use (although it may not be the most useful), but the placement of the textbox with a basic definition of what the farm share was made it a bit more difficult to understand at first (it required more effort).

#### *Aesthetics: 9*
For aethetics, I completely ignored the fact that the visual was hard to understand, and I gave a lot of credit that the visualization itself was pretty. The colors were comforting, and the circles made the design unique.

#### *Engagement: 2*

#### *Overall Observations and What I Would Do Differently*
Overall, I think the author was trying to make a cool visualization, but it was just not appropriate for this type of visual. Many circles are so similar in size to each other that you cannot make any quick comparisons. You would have to scroll over every circle, and even then, you would have to rely on your memory of what you scrolled over to make comparisons. I think the only main takeaways that you can get from this visual is that butter was the largest farm share of retail price and bread was the smallest. My main redesign would be to choose a different visualization to represent the percentages. I liked how they did include some descriptions on the side because as someone who knows nothing about farm value share, I can get a good enough idea to interpret the graph and give a summary.

#### *Primary Audience*
The primary audience would likely be the general public (potentially farmers) or even policy makers. I think that the current visualization is not effective for any audience because it is hard to get many data points out of it.

#### *Recommendations*
As mentioned above, I think it is essential to change the visualization type because it is not effective at displaying the data. The audience cannot pick out quick takeaways aside from the maximum and minimum percentages. 

I would also change the colors scheme for the products. The color groupings seem to not have much correlation. The data source has categories for the products, but they do not correspond to the color choices in the visual.
