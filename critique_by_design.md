#### *Overall Observations and What I Would Do Differently*
Overall, I think the author was trying to make a cool visualization, but it was just not appropriate for this type of visual. Many circles are so similar in size to each other that you cannot make any quick comparisons. You would have to scroll over every circle, and even then, you would have to rely on your memory of what you scrolled over to make comparisons. I think the only main takeaways that you can get from this visual is that butter was the largest farm share of retail price and bread was the smallest. My main redesign would be to choose a different visualization to represent the percentages. I liked how they did include some descriptions on the side because as someone who knows nothing about farm value share, I can get a good enough idea to interpret the graph and give a summary.

#### *Primary Audience*
The primary audience would likely be the general public (potentially farmers) or even policy makers. I think that the current visualization is not effective for any audience because it is hard to get many data points out of it.

#### *Recommendations*
As mentioned above, I think it is essential to change the visualization type because it is not effective at displaying the data. The audience cannot pick out quick takeaways aside from the maximum and minimum percentages. 

I would also change the colors scheme for the products. The color groupings seem to not have much correlation. The data source has categories for the products, but they do not correspond to the color choices in the visual.
