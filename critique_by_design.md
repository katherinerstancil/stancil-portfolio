### [Original Data Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/Farmshareofretailpricevariesacrossfoodproducts/Farmshareofretailpricevariesacrossfoodproducts?:embed=y&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

As a policy student, I frequenly visit government sites and have seen some pretty confusing data visualizations. For this assignment, I decided to browse some government sites until I found a visualization that was difficult for me to understand or was not an appropriate visual for the data.

I felt as if I tried to cram it in, it would look overwhelming and too much. Therefore, I decided to make a second sketch on Tableau to see if there was a way to incorporate both. When I told Tableau that I wanted the both the food category and product on the graph, it put the category on the top and separated it by a line. Then, the food product was on the x-axis. The only thing I had to change was the color palette to have the category have different shades of one color.
