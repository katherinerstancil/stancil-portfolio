# The Final Data Story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/d1afb295-ebe8-41a2-a40a-b165ea389af4/index.html)

## Changes made since Part II
After I completed the first draft of the shorthand page and receiving feedback, I made the following adjustments:

#### Adjusted the Statistics Section
Based on the feedback I received when interviewing a few people, it was mentioned that the two callout statistics were meshed together. Although they tie together, they are separate and having the two too close together made it confusing to some of my readers. Therefore, I put some additional space in between the two, added a divider, and inserted a photo in the second statistic. This really made the statistics a little bit more separate, but still related (by keeping them in the same section).

#### Build Out the 2022 Section
At first, I was not in love with the visual; however, after receiving feedback, I realized that the combined bar and line graph fit the data nicely and was easy to interpret. I used Flourish to create the visual (in part 2, I still only had my sketch). I also changed the colors from the intial sketch because they did not match my theme, and my interviews revealed that they did not like them either. Overall, I am satisfied with how it turned out. If I could do one thing extra, I would include data labels for the bars, but not the line. I was unable to figure out how to just have data labels for the bars, so I felt it was best to leave them all out. With them in, it the visual was way too crowded. Finally, I actually wrote out some information for the 2022 section. There was little to no information at the time of the interviews, and one of my responses requested some information about what Pennsylvania is doing now to help with learning loss. The ARP ESSER funding was something that PA did in 2021, but it was hard to tell if there has been any direct benefit from it.

#### Decision Made About the Map
Prior to conducting interviews, I was indecisive about where to put the map of county averages. Initially I wanted to make the map a big page itself, but it was not really user friendly, and it did not give me the flexibility to have an explanation right next to the map. So, I asked for feedback in my interviews about where to put the map, and the majority seemed to like it next to the text. I also received feedback that I should try to label the different shades of the map, but that was rather difficult to figure out in Tableau, so I just included five shades instead of four to hopefully help with the scale a bit.

#### Citation Links
Previously, the introduction section just had a reference page (not labeled), but my superscript links actually all did not work. I realized when I copied my writing from the Word document, it automatically included a random link. So, I went through and included the real citation links, but also kept the (now labeled) reference page.

#### Additional Link for Resources
I also included an additional link to Khan Academy for parents to find enrichment materials online. This was really the only additioal resource I could think about without being redundant.

#### Overall Cleanup and Added Content
My orginial draft was pretty incomplete when I sent it over to my interviewers, so I generally just did some cleanup. I added more text, rearranged some of the pages, and included a few more design elements (like pictures and played around with layouts).

### The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

### Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
