## Question 3: Own Flourish Visualization

After trying a few different visuals that did not fit the data, I decided to experiment with some of the scatter plots. I decided upon a scatter plot because it is a great alternative to line charts when trying to visualize data over time (especially when the cumulative totals have no meaning). In the tutorial, we created an option to see all countries across a grid, but in this visual, I included a new feature where the user can filter out which country they would like to see individually. Additionally, I included a color gradient for the data points to depict the debt-to-GDP ratio. As the the ratio increases, the colors get darker red because a higher debt-to-GDP ratio is generally a bad sign. I also added a trendline to show that the debt-to-GDP ratios have increased amongst most countries (the line also helps with readability of some of the lighter colors).

Although the two Flourish visuals are very similar, the viewer can make additional conclusions from the second. The user can easily pick out that the debt-to-GDP ratio is generally increasing for countries across the globe through the trendlines. Additionally, the viewer can easily see which countries have very high debt-to-GDP ratios because of the dark red in the gradient. The user now also has the ability to drill down by country and further investigate the ratios over time.
