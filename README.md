# About me
My name is Katherine (she/her), and I am 2nd-year MSPPM student with a concentration in public and non-profit finance. I am interested in fiscal policy and statistics, so this class will be beneficial to improving my visuals to represent data.

# What I hope to learn 

1. **How to simplify visuals when there is so much information that needs to be shown.** Throughout internships I have been asked to present so much information, and often times, my employer is okay with poor visuals just because they want all the information. I want to be able to present the same information but in a better way.
2. **Expand my visual options.** Often I use the standard bar chart, line graph, or pie chart. I want to use this class to explore alternative visuals to show the information in a more creative way.
3. **Be more intentional with color.** I want to learn how to effectively use color rather than just picking random ones. I think color plays a huge role in the data visualization, but I never really knew how to be intentional with the color (I usually just stick to the preset themes or color palette).

## Final Project
My final project is to show the virtual learning consequences on academic performance for third grade students in Pennsylvania. Last semester, I did an econometrics research paper that showed that student learning was negatively impacted by the lockdown, and on average, the school PSSA proficiency rates across the state declined. This paper had no visualizations aside from regression tables, so I decided to use this opportunity to create visuals that supplement my findings. Additionally, the presentation will allow me to give a quick summary to people who are interested in my findings.
