# About me
My name is Katherine (she/her), and I am 2nd-year MSPPM student with a concentration in public and non-profit finance. I am interested in fiscal policy and statistics, so this class will be beneficial to improving my visuals to represent data.

# What I hope to learn 

1. **How to simplify visuals when there is so much information that needs to be shown.** Throughout internships I have been asked to present so much information, and often times, my employer is okay with poor visuals just because they want all the information. I want to be able to present the same information but in a better way.
2. **Expand my visual options.** Often I use the standard bar chart, line graph, or pie chart. I want to use this class to explore alternative visuals to show the information in a more creative way.
3. **Be more intentional with color.** I want to learn how to effectively use color rather than just picking random ones. I think color plays a huge role in the data visualization, but I never really knew how to be intentional with the color (I usually just stick to the preset themes or color palette).
